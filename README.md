# Gophercises

See [gophercises.com](http://gophercises.com) and [calhoun.io](https://courses.calhoun.io/courses/cor_gophercises)

These exercises are available here on GitHub, but I decided that rather than fork each exercise's repository individually, I would simply create this one repository in which to work on all exercises.

As I add each one, I shall link to the relevant GitHub repository here. Additionally, since each exercise has its own `README.md` file, I shall not bother to replicate them here.

## Exercise 1: Quiz

(refer to [Quiz on GitHub](https://github.com/gophercises/quiz)

## Exercise 2: UrlShort

(refer to [UrlShort on GitHub](https://github.com/gophercises/urlshort)
