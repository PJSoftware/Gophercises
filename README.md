# Gophercises
*(via http://gophercises.com and https://courses.calhoun.io/courses/cor_gophercises)*

These exercises are available here on GitHub, but I decided that rather than fork each exercise's repository individually, I would simply create this one repository in which to work on all exercises.

As I add each one, I shall link to the relevant GitHub repository here. Additionally, since each exercise has its own `README.md` file, I shall not bother to replicate them here.

## Exercise 1: Quiz
*(refer to https://github.com/gophercises/quiz)*

Currently written Part 1 of this exercise. I have added code to display the correct answers for those questions the user got wrong.
